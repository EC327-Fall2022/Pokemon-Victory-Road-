## You must pass your code from pa3 to this repository

My code doesn't compile but I did the first three steps and commented parts where I wasn't sure why the errors were occuring so hopefully I can get some credit and you guys as the graders can see my thought process.

Edit: I fixed the compiliation errors. I know this is a bit late but I got my code to compile so I hope to get some points. I believe I did steps 2 and 3 perfectly while step one might have a couple errors with the movement. Just added and removed a few lines for the code to compile and cleaned up my code a bit. I really hope that this doesn't result in me losing all points for late submission.
